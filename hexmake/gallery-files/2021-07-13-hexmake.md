This app allows the user to build its own hex stickers.

On top of being a fun application, it is interesting in several levels when it comes to the technical implementations : 

- {hexmake} comes with a series of tools built on top of {magick} that allow to modify your image. An image that you can upload to the app

- {hexmake} comes with its own file format, .hex, that you can export and reupload if you need to work again on your hex, or share privately with someone else

- {hexmake} is plugged into a mongo db where everybody can save its own hex, making it possible to share hex template worldwide.

- To simplify use first experience, {hexmake} comes with a guided tour, built on top of {cicerone}.

- This app can also be installed as a package, and you can plug your own mongo db to it (or not use it at all, which is the default behavior).


This app was recognized _as a winner_ on the 2020 Shiny Contest.

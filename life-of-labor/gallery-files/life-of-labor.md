This app combines elements of storytelling with statistical methods, data visualization and machine learning as its mean to investigate the intersecting socioeconomic structures that shapes people's life trajectories in the Bolivian society. It makes use of descriptive analytics as well as random forests to assess the most urgent characteristics that presses on society.  

Additionally, to make data more human, the app uses a function that randomizes the characteristics of working children to tell a short story about them, their background and future possibilities.   


This app was recognized _as a runner up_ on the 2021 Shiny Contest.

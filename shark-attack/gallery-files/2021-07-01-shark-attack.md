The ocean is the origin and the engine of all life on this planet â€” and it is under threat.
The game goal is to spread the awerness of the environmental issues via enjoyable way.
In the game the user (as a diver) will have one minute to collect as much trash as possible while avoiding sharks (on different difficulty levels).
The detailed tutorial is presented in the game main menu.

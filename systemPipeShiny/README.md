## App description

[systemPipeShiny (SPS)](https://github.com/systemPipeR/systemPipeShiny) is an R/Bioconductor package that provides a Shiny application 
for interactive data analysis workflow management and downstream data visualization. 
SPS allows non-R users, such as experimentalists, to design, control, execute and 
visualize data analysis workflows interactively without requiring knowledge of R. 
Moreover, SPS has been designed as a general purpose framework to allow users 
to perform deep customization and add their own components.

Additional description is provided in this [Github repository](https://github.com/systemPipeR/spsDemo).
